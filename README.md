# QSAR Analysis of Telomerase Inhibitors

Telomerase is an important target for anti-cancer drugs, as it plays a crucial role in cell immortality. The inhibition of telomerase has been shown to have anti-tumor effects, making it a promising target for drug discovery. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the inhibition of telomerase using QSAR data.
